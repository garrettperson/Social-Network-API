# Social Network API

  ## Description
  This project is an API for a social network where people can post their thoughts, react to thoughts, and connect to each other as friends. My motivation in building this project was to learn more about working with NoSQL, specifically MongoDB, as well as the Mongoose ODM, and to learn more about routing with Express.js. This project solves the problem of needing an API for a social networking site.

  One simply navigates to the project folder and opens an integrated terminal. Then one runs npm install to load the packages. After that one runs npm run seed. To activate the project run nodemon server.js.

  ## Usage

  Once the project is running one can use Insomnia to test the routes and create thoughts and users using POST requests, delete thoughts and users, edit thoughts and user information using PUT requests,  view thoughts and users using GET requests, add a friend using a POST request, delete a friend, add a reaction using a POST request, and delete a reaction.
